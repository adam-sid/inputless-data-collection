This repo will hold the source documents for a prototype 

## Technologies
- **Server/Backend**
	- Node.js and Express.js - for building backend server
	- TypeScript - generally considered better than writing in standard JavaScript as it is more strongly typed and therefore helpful for avoiding bugs.
	- Jest - modern testing framework that works with typescript
- **Website/frontend (will be held on a separate repo to be made shortly)**
	- 
- **Hosting**
	- Currently using [render](https://render.com/) as it has a free tier
	- Downside is this does not run continuously so would need a paid option down the line (cost ~Â£5 p.m)
